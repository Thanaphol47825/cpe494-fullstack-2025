# MEP-1004 Human Resource

module: hr

## Description

Create model, controller, CLI, and other necessary utilities to manage human resources related information.
for ModEd:

- Student [1:1]  
  Each student has a single record determining whether they are:
  - Regular Student
  - International Student

- Department [1:N]
  Each Department may have multiple Instructors.
  - Instructor

The implemented module must be able to import data from CSV and JSON files and dumped
into SQLite database and list the data from DB. Note that database vendor should be able
to choose later using GORM. Models can be added according to the requirements of other
modules.

The relation between models (1-to-1, 1-to-N, N-to-N) must be considered.
